    <h2>A bit about this experiment</h2>
    <p>
      This is a new blog template to make a new site for writing. It's
      practice for my web development skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been out of the game for awhile, so need to do some more
      development to make a page worth sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm building this site from scratch to make everything more
      clear again.
    </p>
    <h3>Here are some things that I plan to add:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An index page that links all the entries together</li>
      <li>
        Series of pages that will be individual blog entries. All will
        have some of my writing in them.
      </li>
      <li>
        I should probably write a bit about technology and my journey.
      </li>
      <li>This should all be anonymous</li>
    </ul>
