In our neighborhood it seems like all the wooded areas around here have standing water, probably because the soil is dense clay that doesn't absorb water.  Because of this standing water and our humid climate, we get a lot of mosquitoes in our backyard in the warmer months.  The best solution to combat the mosquito swarms is by using a device called [Thermacell E90 Rechargeable Mosquito Repeller](https://www.thermacell.com/products/e90-rechargeable-mosquito-repeller), which keeps the mosquitoes from biting. We use a Thermacell all summer long and it works really well for repelling mosquitoes during our backyard activities.  It is the best repellent that I've ever used.

## The device

The Thermacell E90 is a small device that works by emitting a chemical called [metofluthrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metofluthrin).  It has a small heater that warms a wick that diffuses the repellent in the air within an eight foot radius around it, creating a protective "bubble" or spherical no-fly-zone for mosquitoes.  The device itself is very small and portable, so you can take it anywhere (camping, picnics, etc.).  It has a rechargeable battery that can be recharged via a USB port.  When it's on and working, it emits metofluthrin that is not noticeable or toxic (in the low concentrations used) to people or pets.

## The repellent

The reason the Thermacell works so well is because of the novel properties of methofluthrin.  Methofluthrin is a chemical that was developed by the Sumitomo Chemical Company in Japan in 2005, modelled after the known naturally occuring chemicals derived from chrysanthemums that have been long been used to repel insects.  The cool thing about methofluthrin is that it interacts with the mosquito's sense of smell and makes them not want to feed and therefore not bite you.  Mosquitoes will not bite you as long as you're within the protective range of the Thermacell. At the amounts emitted by the Thermacell, metofluthrin is effective and safe and poses no dangers to people or pets.  

It seems that the Thermacell company has exclusivity to methofluthrin in the US, as they are the only company that seems to use it.  It may also explain why the devices that use it are more expensive. 


If you're interested in chemistry and how metofluthrin was discovered, you can read more about it [here](https://www.sumitomo-chem.co.jp/english/rd/report/files/docs/20050200_imi.pdf). 

## The cost

The Thermacell is costly up front, with the device costing around $49.99, including a cartridge that will last for 17 hours.  You can buy replacement cartridges for $17-20 at Lowes, which seems steep until you consider that these cartridges will last 30-40 hours, which will pretty much have you covered for the summer.  In the backyard, tt's way cheaper and safer than spraying for mosquitoes, plus it repells mosquitoes from outside the spray zone and it doesn't kill all the other bugs we (bees, pollinators) we don't want to bother!

The E90 can be found online, we found ours at Costco last year.  The Costco deal was a good one, as it came with a 40 hour cartridge for $49.99.  The ones at Lowes only come with a 17-hour cartridge.
