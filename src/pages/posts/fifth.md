## It's not something you can easily pick up in one week.

If you really want to be god at something, meaning, you're so good at that someone would pay you to do it, you're going to have to spend some time learning that skill.

Anything that anyone can pick up in a short period of time or has a low barrier to entry is more likely than not easily replicable and not of very high value.  It's just a matter of supply and demand.  If someone can do something easily or cheaply themselves, they won't pay others very much anything at all to do it.

There is no one and done.  When you sign-up to learn this stuff, you embark on a journey, not a quick trip.

## You must train

Just like any athletic endeavor or sport, you must regularly train for coding.  You must grind through problems and projects to really understand how a programming language or library/framework works.  

## What are your advantages that you can leverage?

Are you unemployed with a lot of time on your hands?  Use that to your advantage!  You could even consider it a competitive advantage...most people don't have that much time on their hands.  In your case, you could use this time to your advantage to learn something new, practice and really get good at it.  This can really level the playing field.

Do you have any friends that are programmers?  If so, ask if they are willing to help you in *any* capacity.  You could come up with some questions for them to help you with, pair-program with you on a problem or project, or you could build something together.  At very least, you could get together and just talk about what you're learning and working on.

Are you a slow learner?  Use this to your advantage to give yourself permission to learn something slowly, practice it a lot, and really learn it inside and out.  Take your time. Grind.  You will more likely than not come out understanding something way better than most others that are considered proficient.

There are so many different situations that you can find yourself in that may at first seem like you're at a disadvantage to learn something, but may actually be an advantage.  Everyone learns and absorbs things at a different rate and in a different way, and it takes some longer than others to grasp different concepts.  That's OK.  Always do the best you can, learn from your mistakes and failures and try again.

## Find the joy in it

Learning sytax, solving problems, reading and watching YouTube videos about your chosen programming language or syntax.  Build simple things, just for you, with the tools you've learned.

Find the things you really like about what you're learning.  It could be something as simple as "Wow, I made that little bit of code and it makes the first letter of that word uppercase!" or "Now I can use this code that I wrote to calculate the natural logarithm of any number I give it!"  or "Wow, that code changes the screen color from pink to purple!".  Just because it may not impress others doesn't mean it doesn't have to impress you.  

## Develop a growth mindset
