## It's not something you can easily pick up in one week.

If you want to be good enough at something that someone would pay you to do it, you're going to have to spend some time learning that skill.

Anything that anyone can pick up in a short period of time or has a low barrier to entry is more likely than not easily replicable and not of very high value.  If someone can do something easily or cheaply themselves, they will do it themselves or they won't pay others very much to do it.  It's a rare person that can make a fortune scrubbing toilets.

When you decide to learn programming, you embark on a journey, not a quick trip.  There is too much to know for any one person to learn and implement effectively.  

There are many things on the internet advertising learning a programming language in a short period of time.  *Learn JavaScript in 2 Weeks!*, *Learn Java in One Day!*.  These things are bullshit.  To really consider yourself as someone that has learned a thing, you have to demonstrate some competency with it.  It's impossible to do that in a short period of time for most people.

## You must train

Just like any athletic endeavor or sport, you must regularly train for coding.  You must grind through problems and projects to really understand how a programming language or library/framework works.  

This is true for just about anything that is worthwhile.  Roller skating, typing, learning a new spoken language, tying your shoes all require some practice to develop some proficiency.  

The same couldn't be more true than for programming.

## You will fail. A lot.

Be prepared to fail.  Your code will not work the way you want it to most of the time, especially when starting out.  You will get errors, unexpected results and things will crash.  One of the best ways to learn how to not do something is by doing it the wrong way and failing your way through the learning process.  

Imagine if you were successful implementing some code on your first try, but didn't fully understand why or how it works.  Is that a success or a failure?  It's actually just dumb luck.

## What are your advantages that you can leverage?

Are you unemployed with a lot of time on your hands?  Use that to your advantage!  You could even consider it a competitive advantage...most people don't have that much time on their hands.  In your case, you could use this time to your advantage to learn something new, practice and really get good at it.  This can really level the playing field.  You do not need a fast, powerful or new computer to learn programming, and much of the learning can be done in the web browser.

Do you have any friends that are programmers?  If so, ask if they are willing to help you in *any* capacity.  You could come up with some questions about a basic problem you're having trouble with or do some pair-programming together.  At very least, you could get together and just talk about what you're learning and working on.

Are you a slow learner?  Use this to your advantage to give yourself permission to learn something slowly, practice it a lot, and really learn it inside and out.  Take your time. Grind.  You will more likely than not come out understanding something way better than most others that are considered proficient.

There are so many different situations that you can find yourself in that may at first seem like you're at a disadvantage to learn something, but may actually be an advantage.  Everyone learns and absorbs things at a different rate and in a different way, and it takes some longer than others to grasp different concepts.  That's OK.  Always do the best you can, learn from your mistakes and failures and try again.

## Find the joy in it

If you don't like doing something, chances are you're going to do it.  This is as true for programming as it is for washing dishes.  Some are allured to programming because of the opportunities to work remotely and the potential for a sizable salary.  If you don't like spending hours arranging characters on a screen and poring over documentation to figure out how to make something work, it's likely that you won't be successful learning program.

Are you into learning sytax, solving problems, reading and watching YouTube videos about your chosen programming language or syntax?  Does the idea of building things and fine tuning them excite you? 

Find the things you really like about what you're learning.  It could be something as simple as "Wow, I made that little bit of code and it makes the first letter of that word uppercase!" or "Now I can use this code that I wrote to calculate the natural logarithm of any number I give it!"  or "Wow, that code changes the screen color from pink to purple!".  Just because it may not impress others doesn't mean it doesn't have to impress you.  Build simple things, just for you, with the tools you've learned.

## Develop a growth mindset

In 2006, the psychologist [Carol Dwek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck) published the book *Mindset: The New Psychology of Success*.  In it, she describes the idea of a __growth mindset__:

>Developing a growth mindset is a process of embracing challenges and learning opportunities as a means of growth and improvement. It involves shifting one's perspective from a fixed mindset, which views intelligence and abilities as set traits, to a growth mindset where these characteristics can be developed through effort and learning. Cultivating a growth mindset can lead to increased resilience, better self-esteem, and a more positive outlook on life. This mindset allows individuals to approach challenges with a positive attitude, view failures as opportunities for growth, and continue to work towards their goals even in the face of obstacles. By developing a growth mindset, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve their goals in life.  - spot on ChatGPT summary of Growth Mindset

When you have a growth mindset, you can more effectively deal with failure and work through setbacks.  You realize that when something didn't work as intended, there's something that wasn't implemented well.  It's a prompt to go learn more about that particular thing.

## Computers don't think like people

Computers may seem smart, but they are really dumb.  They may be able to do all sorts of incredible things like calculate the 20th number in the Fibonacci sequence in milliseconds or power a voice assistant like Siri, but they are very limited and require explicit, step-by-step instructions to do EVERYTHING.  Writing steps for a computer to act on is really what a programmer does.  If those steps aren't written in the way the computer likes them, it will get upset.  There's no room for nuance, intuition or common sense when it comes to computers.

Computers are machines and they don't work the same way our minds work.  Yes, them may be able to follow complex logic like the most renowned philosophers, but they can't deviate from a pattern unless explicity directed to do so.  Our minds are extremely flexible and varied and were created to react to external stimuli as detected by our senses.  You can easily navigate through a 3D world of obstacles or read the puzzled look on a strangers face.  Computers, on the other hand, must read lines of code, often line by line, with no deviation.

It's a good idea to spend some time learning how computers *actually* read, interpret and execute the code that you've written.  This context will help you write better programs.
